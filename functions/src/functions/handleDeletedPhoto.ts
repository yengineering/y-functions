Examples:
- From meditation cushions to city lights, my energy stays aligned
- Trading crystal grids for coffee grounds, still channeling that higher power
- Universe really said "from sage burning to burger flipping" and I felt that
- Went from forest bathing to city racing, still got that spiritual cardio

Keep it short, mystical, and a little funny. ONE line only.`

Examples:
- Went from corner store to corner office but kept that same energy
- Started with dollar menu now we're here, still counting blessings tho
- Trading subway seats for CEO chairs but still eating the same snacks
- From bodega runs to business runs but the fit still fresh
